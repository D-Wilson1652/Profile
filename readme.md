UPDATE 
----- 

When trying to deploy this code via github pages, it searches for 2 things, an index.html file and a README.md file. 
during the creation of this code, i didn't use index.html and i have since changed computers.

with this in mind, i would recommend running this off of a local host machine using visual code studio 

The demonstration video should show you what the layout and code should look like

I will have a look at trying to rectify this mistake

# CTEC3905 ASSIGNMENT - Dylan Wilson

Welcome to my repository. In this repository, I have created a porfolio website to market myself towards future employers. The website showcases who i am, my cv, the modules I have learnt over my degree and a form to contact me (more on that later). 

My site has a top down layout using css.grid style whenever possible. My navigation bar is ever present and non colapsable so the user can navigate freely around the website. I have included 4 sections each with different purposes. Any page with a lot of text on i have put into a collapsable button which expands upon a click. the responsive design has been tested between the smallest moblie screen of the Iphone 5 (320 x 568) and a HD screen (1920 x 1080) 

My site is mainly text based and autosizes with the browser. However, if a picture or an icon flows off the screen when resizing i have either made its size shrink with the browser or I have swapped its grid layout and size.     

Within my JavaScript code there is a function that isnt an arrow function. this is because the function() retains its binding to the window aka binds to the specified button. for simplicity sake i have opted to include that as my only non arrow function. reasons are elaborated more in the youtube video in references. 

My contact me system is using a 3rd party resourse which sends emails to me and me only. To prove that my email system works i have attatched a short demonstration video showcasing the usability of it.

If i had more time i would animate the fade in and out of the different sections. I attempted this in the last few weeks but so far i have been unsuccessful.
Enjoy my website and thank you for running a very interesting module.
